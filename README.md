# Adaptive-Micro-Gesture-Recognition
The project will follow a modular structure, separating concerns like data preprocessing, model definition, training, inference, and whiteboard integration, while being adaptable for the LeapGestRecog Dataset and the Lightweight Micro-Gesture Transformer (LMGT).
